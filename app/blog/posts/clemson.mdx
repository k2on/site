summary: "My experience at Clemson."
---

I applied to 3 schools, University of Maryland, Virgina Tech, and Clemson. Only Clemson accepted me so it made my decision very easy.

During the day time, my only focus was on making a successful technology company so that I could make as much money as possible. While at night I immediatly started going downtown, binge drinking, smoking weed, and being sexually promiscuous.

It was not until sophomore year, that I made some new friends who lived differently than the other students. They started to get me to read the Bible and learn about the life of Jesus.

I started to realize that they lived differently because of their faith in Jesus, and to an athiest, their faith seemed like really foolish and silly. While their beliefs that a man could rise from the dead and preform all these miracles didn't seem real, their actions and love for me and others was more real than anyone else I had met before.

I wanted to believe, I just wasn't sure, util I realized that I had to have faith. There was no sign that would come to confirm it, or some logical argument that would prove it, I just had to trust in Jesus.

And on Febuary 22nd, 2024, I confessed that Jesus is Lord and believed in my heart that God rose Him from the dead, and I was saved from my sin and from hell. [(Romans 10:9)](https://www.bible.com/bible/3034/rom.10.9).
