When I first installed Linux on my laptop, I set up Xorg and tried to use it with dwm and all that fun stuff.


I didn't really use it that much however because of things like the volume buttons and brightness buttons not working. Eventually I would get them to work and slowly get it more functional.


## New Thought Process

I had a realization, if I want other people to use Linux, I wouldn't want them go use that setup. I would want them to use the same setup as me, so that I would know the problems that they might face and how to fix them.

> You might not agree with this thought process, and I might expand on it later.

## Making the Switch

The thing that allowed me to switch from MacOS to Linux, once and for all, was installing KDE Plasma and Wayland.

There was one problem, the laptop would get really hot, and was not smooth at all. I found out that the GPU was not getting used. And it took me a little bit to enable GPU support, but once I got that working it was BUTTER. I can not stress how different the system feels with graphics working.

I only found one problem with this setup, the HDMI output does not work after the laptop wakes from sleep. Please contact me if you know how to fix that.

After using this for a few days, I can 100% recommend this system to non technical people, even for technical people.

I am going to post my NixOS configuration later in the year, once I get `git.koon.us` online and clean up the configuration up a bit.
