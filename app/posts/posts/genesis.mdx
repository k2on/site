## Usage:

```sh
genesis new geneaology.koon.us

# shorter
genesis new genealogy

# even shorter
genesis n genealogy

# with an alias
gn genealogy
```

This will do 4 things:

1. This will create a new repo at `git.koon.us` called `genealogy`.
2. Bootstrap a simple React Native application, with zero sync, OIDC authentication with `auth.koon.us`.
3. Creates a new release of the application in a container registry.
4. Deploys the application in the kubernetes cluster at `genealogy.koon.us`
