I want a system, where I have a flashdrive for each computer, that will restore a system back to normal, whether that system is my laptop, server, or even phone.

I was a system that is easy to quickly restore from a total loss of infrastructure without reliance on the cloud. 

- ark     (primary server, SC)
- restore (backup server,  CT)


Level 0   -  Complete loss of location 1
- No phone
- No laptop
- No server
- No internet
- No backups on location 1


# Sovereignty level

1. No internet - Only physical access to backup server
2. Internet No Cloud - Port forwarding & static IP (No DNS)
3. Internet w/ Cloud - Cloudflare Tunnel
