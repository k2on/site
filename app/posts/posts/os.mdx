I want a system, where I have a flashdrive for each computer, that will restore a system back to normal, whether that system is my laptop, server, or even phone.


- ark     (primary server, SC)
- restore (backup server,  CT)


Level 0   -  Complete loss of location 1
- No phone
- No laptop
- No server
- No internet
- No backups
