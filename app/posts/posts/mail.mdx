I am going to fix email for myself once and for all.

There are some requirements:

1. Create different emails for each internet account
2. Have a single screen that displays all email accounts (including work and school accounts)
3. Offline access of mail
4. Self-hostable

Todo:

- [ ] Use SES to send email
- [ ] Create an incoming email server (NixOS in Vultur). We need this for the static IP.
- [ ] Backend application (Using Zero Sync)
- [ ] Create web frontend
- [ ] Create terminal frontend (bonus)
- [ ] Create a mobile frontend (extra bonus)

## Design

1. Incoming Email
   - Gmail: It [looks](https://developers.google.com/workspace/gmail/api/reference/rest/v1/users/watch) like you can have a listener for new emails, and will get sent to the backend.
   - Other: When an incoming email gets sent to the Vultr server, it will send a message to the backend.
2. Message gets stored in Postgres DB & Zero Sync updates interfaces (Web, CLI, and Mobile)
3. Outgoing Email
   - Gmail: Use Gmail APIs to send emails
   - Other: Uses Amazon's SES API to send emails
